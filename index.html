                <h3>Greetings.</h3>

                <p>Welcome to my personal website. This website is a portfolio that desrcribes myself, what I have accomplished, my experiences, and what I aim to accomplish. 
                    I was born and raised in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, a quiet suburb about an hour outside of downtown 
                    Toronto. I grew up in a culturally diverse household with my mother and father both immigrants
                    from Japan and Greece, respectively. Through this blessing I have been a part of two very beautiful cultures. I am able to speak 4 languages, English, Japanese, Greek,
                    and French. Throughout my high school days, I focused on basketball and football resulting in little care towards my school work. I enjoyed playing organized team sports and to this day 
                    I think it is one of main reasons I am who I am. Basketball and Football gave me many skills that cannot be obtained in the classroom, such as, work ethic, discpline, collaboration with others for a common goal and many more.
                    I am thankful for the experiences and lasting friendships I gained from playing those sports in my youth. 
                </p>
                <p>  After high school, I pursued an engineering degree at the University of Guelph. School was never something I had a significant care for. However, my interests in school were physics and math and from a 
                    young age I was enjoyed building things, hence, my mother insisted that I should go into engineering. Like most people I was not sure if this was the right path to take, luckily, I did not see myself in anything else. Additionally,
                    the challenge that an engineering degree brings was appealing. I finished my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering in four years. I thoroghly enjoyed my time at the University of Guelph with the many friendships and experiences 
                    I was able to obtain. I was able to gain a plethora of skills both techincal and soft skills, furthermore, I found a career path that I am passionate about, robotics and mechatronics.
                </p>
                <p>	I spend a lot of my free time researching upcoming technologies and tinkering with different things that interest me. I also thoroughly enjoy travelling, I have been to 10 different countries, majority of them in Europe when I lived in Germany for a summer.
                    I am very outgoing, open-minded and enjoy long deep conversations, however, I do value the time I have to myself. My career goal is to be in the robotics industry and to have some contribution to innovative technologies that shape the way we live.

                                   Graduated from the University of Guelph in April of 2019 with a Bachelor of Engineering with my major in mechanical engineering. I met and made many good friends 
                                   and colleagues throughout my time at this University while developing thorough technical and soft skills necessary in the engineering profession. The Engineering 
                                   Program is an exceptional program that emphasized not only the knowledge required to be an engineer but also requiring the students to apply the concepts learned 
                                   in class through various design courses and projects every year. Being a hands-on learner myself made my learning experience at Guelph exceptional. I truly enjoyed 
                                   my time at the University of Guelph and I will take the lessons and skills I learned on to my future endeavors.

                                    <p>As part of the third year Introduction to Mechatronics Systems Design course. In a design team of 5 members including myself, 
                                        we were tasked with developing a machine that could determine the type of screw nut it was given and sort these screw nuts to 
                                        their respective piles. Furthermore, the machine was to be able to differentiate between coins as well. The types of screw nuts 
                                        that had to be sorted were large brass, large plastic, small brass, and small steel nuts. The constraints for this nut sorting 
                                        machine was that the machine could not be past certain dimensions in height, width and length. Additionally, the machine had to 
                                        be cost effective meaning less sensors used to sort the items resulted in a higher grade and the material cost could not exceed 
                                        $50.00. The provided electronics were an Adruino Mega 2560, stepper motor, servo, motor controller, and various sensors (interrupt 
                                        switches, hall effect, thermistor, force, etc.). Our design utilized two interrupt switches and a conductivity switch. The code 
                                        involved utilizing interrupts to synchronize with the stepper motor steps, therefore, a certain amount of rotation of the stepper 
                                        motor would allow the object to go through all the sensors and give the servo enough time to rotate to the proper cup based on the 
                                        triggered interrupt sensors to drop the object. The manufacturing of the machine consisted of wood, acrylic tubing, and aluminum 
                                        attached utilizing various fasteners. The project URL is the finished machine showing the accurate and efficient sorting of each 
                                        type of nut as well as the different coins.</p>

                                    and was to solve the issue with residential lawn aerating. Most residential lawn aerators are manual and the task at hand can be very

                                <p>As part of the second year Engineering Design 2 course. In a design team of 5 students including myself, 
                                        we were presented with the option of designing a device with the following constraints: it must be able to 
                                        fit inside a large Easter kinder egg treat when disassembled, but be larger than the egg assembled. It must 
                                        traverse 2.5 meters by: ground, projectile motion or vertical flight. Our device followed the ground traversing 
                                        method. We designed our mechanism based off of Theo Jansen’s Strandbeest. The mechanism was first designed in 
                                        SOLIDWORKS to ensure a working prototype could be developed. The individual components were designed to be able 
                                        to snap fit together, it also incorporated a simple wired DC circuit with a switch, portable battery and motor 
                                        to operate the mechanism. The device worked on most surfaces, but due to the two legged design based on space 
                                        and assembly constraints of the kinder egg, as well as, the alignment of the motor in the battery encasement 
                                        creating a weight imbalance, the W.A.H.M. walked in a helical path on wood.

                            <p>As part of the second year Engineering Design 2 course. In a team of 5 students including myself, 
                                we were tasked with the deconstruction of a sewing machine, documenting each component disassembled. 
                                Then the reconstruction of the sewing machine in SOLIDWORKS matching the physical model of the sewing 
                                machine. The team members divided up generating the parts of the sewing machine in SOLIDWORKS. 
                                We were then tasked to generate our own independent video of a SOLIDWORKS animation of the sewing machine. 
                                Attached is the link to my animation.</p>

                                    we were tasked with the designing of a mechanno kit vehicle that incorporated an Arduino 
                                    interfaced drive train utilizing a motor. The vehicle had to meet certain constraints: it had 
                                    to be able to traverse a specified distance and overcome 2 speed bumps at a height of 1cm between 
                                    the specified distance. The vehicle could not tip when placed on a ramp with an angle of 30 degrees. 
                                    Additionally, the vehicle had to be able to launch a ping pong ball through some sort of mechanism on 
                                    the vehicle into a hoop at a height of 2 meters from a fixed distance from the start point. All these 
                                    constraints had to be met while a passenger sat in the vehicle and the passenger must have been able 
                                    to fall out of the vehicle when the vehicle was inverted. The vehicle was fully designed in SOLIDWORKS 
                                    and analyzed to determine centre of gravity. Launch angle angle and power of ping pong ball as well as 
                                    tipping angle we’re all calculated by hand. Actual functionality of motor was done with trial and error 
                                    of Arduino code interfacing in order to launch ping pong ball through hoop and traverse specified distance 
                                    with speed bumps. Attached is the documentation video of the vehicle undergoing the two trials.</p>
